ðŸ§  Mental Health in Tech â€“ Stigma Classifier

This project analyzes the Mental Health in Tech Survey to predict whether individuals perceive negative consequences from discussing mental health at work â€” used as a proxy for workplace stigma.

Built using classification models (see notebook for details), the final solution is deployed as a Streamlit app that can:

Help employers assess and address mental health stigma in their organizations

Allow individuals to estimate stigma in their workplace through survey-style input

The goal is to support mental wellness in tech by promoting awareness, early action, and cultural change.
